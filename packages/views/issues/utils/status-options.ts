 * The statuses a user can pick or filter by, as one flat list in canonical
 * category order (MUL-6243, MUL-6399).
 *
 * Category is carried per option rather than expressed as a heading. Shape
 * and color belong to the concrete status and convey no automation behavior.
 *
 * Shared by the status picker and the status filter so the two can never drift
 * — a status offered in one and missing from the other is exactly how an issue
 * becomes unfindable.
 *
 * Archived statuses are excluded by default: archiving retires a status from
 * future assignment. A read-only filter can opt specific current keys back in
 * through `includeArchivedKeys`, so existing issues remain findable without a
 * picker offering a retired value for assignment.
 *
 * `archive` (fork status #39) is appended by hand. It is not a catalog
 * category, so the loop below cannot produce it — but it has to stay on this
 * list, because this list is the ONLY way to archive an issue and the only way
 * to filter for archived work. It sorts last, where STATUS_ORDER puts it.
