-- Per-runtime model cost budgets. One row per scope: user_id IS NULL is the
-- runtime total (blocks every user when reached); a non-NULL user_id caps the
-- tasks whose agent that user owns. A NULL limit means unlimited for that
-- period, and a row whose three limits are all NULL is deleted by the
-- application rather than kept, so "no row" is the only representation of
-- "no budget". Limits are ticks of 1e-10 USD (pricing.CostUSDTicksPerUSD).
-- The *_notified_period_start columns remember which period already got its
-- "limit reached" inbox notice so the notice fires once per period.
-- No foreign keys by repository rule; runtime delete and member revoke remove
-- rows in application code.
--
-- id is NOT declared inline as PRIMARY KEY: the repo convention (migrations
-- 332-334) builds the table without one, creates the backing unique index
-- CONCURRENTLY in its own single-statement migration (539), then attaches it
-- with PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX (540). An inline PRIMARY KEY would build its
-- index non-concurrently, which the migration rules forbid even on a new table.
--
-- Renumbered 452 -> 538 with 450-455 when upstream took those prefixes; the
-- DDL here and in 539-541 is idempotent, so a database that already ran the
-- 452-455 stems replays them as no-ops.
