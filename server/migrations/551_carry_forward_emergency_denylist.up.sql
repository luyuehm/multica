-- Migration 536_user_account_status (originally 342, renumbered on each
-- upstream sync) defaults every user to account_status = 'active', which
-- silently re-enabled
-- the two production accounts previously blocked by the
-- deleted emergency denylist (server/internal/auth/temporary_disabled_users.go,
-- removed in 153183072 once account_status enforcement landed). Carry those
-- four identities (2 user IDs, 2 emails) forward into account_status so the
-- denylist's effect is preserved rather than lost.
--
-- Renumbered with its sibling (343 -> 399 -> 442 -> 451 -> 537). Unlike the
-- DDL migrations, replaying this UPDATE under a new stem is not a no-op: it
-- would re-suspend an account an admin has since restored. The ledger guard
-- makes a database that already ran any earlier stem skip the write.
