-- Attach the CONCURRENTLY-built unique index as the table's primary key.
--
-- Guarded because 538 is conditionally skippable in practice. A database that
-- ran an EARLIER revision of this branch got the table with an inline PRIMARY
-- KEY on id, and one that ran the pre-renumber 452-455 stems already has this
-- constraint; either way 538 is CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, so it is recorded
-- without executing, and an unguarded ALTER here would fail with
-- "multiple primary keys for table are not allowed" — leaving the instance
-- stuck below 540 forever. AGENTS.md's rule for conditionally skipped
-- migrations: later migrations touching the objects they introduce must be
-- idempotent.
--
-- When the old inline primary key is what exists, a uidx an earlier 453 built
-- is a redundant duplicate of the constraint's own index. Nothing depends on it and
-- it is not dropped here: DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run in the same
-- multi-statement file, and a plain DROP INDEX would take an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
-- lock for a purely cosmetic cleanup. Only pre-merge branch databases can be in
-- this state, and an operator who hits it can reclaim the space by hand with
-- `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY runtime_cost_budget_pkey_uidx`.
