-- Deletes every daemon_token row matching the (workspace_id, daemon_id)
-- pairs implied by `daemon_ids`. Used by member revocation and account
-- suspension to nuke tokens for all runtimes a member owned in one shot.
-- The delete IS the revocation: the mdt_ auth path is deliberately
-- uncached (see middleware.DaemonAuth), so it takes effect on the
-- daemon's very next request. token_hash is returned for logging.
