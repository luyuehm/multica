// Package dispatch holds the canonical, cross-layer vocabulary for execution
// admission outcomes (MUL-4525). It is a leaf package (no internal deps) so both
// the service layer — which MAKES the admission/skip decision and therefore owns
// the reason at its source — and the handler layer — which serializes it to the
// wire — share one enum and can never drift.
//
// A ReasonCode is decided at the branch that blocks/skips a run and carried
// through to the response verbatim; it is never reverse-engineered from a
// human-readable failure string. Codes are stable, localizable by clients, and
// enumeration-safe: a code never reveals whether a private agent exists, its
// name, or its owner.
