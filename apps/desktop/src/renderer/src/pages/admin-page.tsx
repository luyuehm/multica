/**
 * `/admin` is a session-level full-window view outside the dashboard shell
 * (system administration is global, not workspace-scoped), so it mounts its
 * own `<DragStrip />` as the first flex child rather than relying on
 * `WorkspaceRouteLayout` — see CLAUDE.md "Full-window desktop views".
 *
 * Unlike WorkspaceRouteLayout (which never mounts unauthenticated — App.tsx
 * renders <DesktopLoginPage> instead), this route IS reachable while signed
 * in as a non-admin: the sidebar entry that links here is gated on
 * `is_system_admin === true`, but nothing stops a signed-in non-admin from
 * still holding a stale/persisted tab pointed at "/admin" (e.g. after a
 * workspace owner's admin flag is revoked). Mirror the web guard
 * (apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx) and render nothing while loading or when the
 * signed-in user is not an admin — the server still 403s /api/admin/* calls
 * regardless, so this is a UX nicety, not the security boundary.
