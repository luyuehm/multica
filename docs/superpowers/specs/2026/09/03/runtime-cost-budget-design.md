# Runtime Cost Budget Design

## Goal

Let a runtime's owner cap the estimated model spend of their runtime.
A runtime gets an optional total budget, and individual users can get their
own budget on that runtime. Each budget is a set of daily, weekly and monthly
USD limits; an empty limit means unlimited. When a limit is reached, new agent
runs that would spend against it are refused until the period rolls over.

## Amendment - 2026-09-04: budgets are the runtime owner's call

The first implementation gated `PUT /api/runtimes/{id}/budget` on the
workspace owner/admin role and described budgets as workspace governance.
That is wrong for this product: a runtime is one person's machine, spending
their credentials and their local quota, which is exactly why
`canSetRuntimeVisibility` is owner-only. A cap on that spend is the same kind
of decision, so an admin who could set it would be budgeting somebody else's
account.

The permission is therefore narrowed to the runtime owner alone, with no
workspace-owner or admin override. An ownerless runtime (profile-created, or
an owner since removed) has nobody who qualifies, so its budget is read-only.
`can_manage` in the `GET` body follows the same rule. Notification recipients
are unchanged: the refused agent's owner and the runtime owner.

The rest of this document reflects the amended rule. Dropping the `204`
branch follows from it: the only writer left is a reader of their own runtime,
so there is never a body to withhold.

## Decisions taken with the product owner

- Budgets attach to a runtime. The runtime total counts every task the
  runtime executes. A per-user budget counts the tasks on that runtime whose
  agent is owned by that user, matching the existing "Cost by owner" tab.
- Daily, weekly and monthly limits may be set together. Any reached limit
  blocks. The runtime total blocks everyone; a per-user limit blocks only that
  user's agents.
- Blocking is a hard refusal at enqueue time. The run is not queued. Periods
  reset on the calendar; a refused run is not retried automatically, the user
  triggers it again.
- Period boundaries are computed in UTC for every scope: a day is the UTC
  calendar day, a week starts Monday 00:00 UTC, a month starts on the first
  at 00:00 UTC. User and runtime timezone preferences do not affect budgets.
  The UI shows reset times in the viewer's timezone but labels the period
  as UTC so a reset at 08:00 local is not read as a bug.
- Spend that the server cannot price does not count. Provider-reported cost
  (`task_usage.cost_usd_ticks`) is authoritative. Rows without it are priced
  with the server rate table; models the server cannot price count as zero.
  Browser-local custom prices never affect enforcement. Missing Copilot
  telemetry therefore under-counts, and the UI says the figure is a lower
  bound.

## Current state

Cost is computed only in the browser. `estimateCost` in
`packages/views/runtimes/utils.ts` prices `RuntimeUsage` rows from a
TypeScript rate table plus a localStorage store of custom prices. The server
stores tokens and optional provider cost and has a second rate table in
`server/internal/metrics/pricing.go` that only feeds Prometheus. There is no
server-side USD figure, no budget concept, and no per-user usage rollup.
`ListRuntimeUsageByAgent` in `server/pkg/db/queries/runtime_usage.sql`
already aggregates cost buckets per agent for a runtime since a cutoff, which
is the shape a budget check needs.

Admission outcomes use `dispatch.ReasonCode`
(`server/internal/dispatch/reason.go`) carried from the service layer to
`DispatchOutcome` in `server/internal/handler/admission.go`. The
attribution refusal `ErrAttributionFailClosed` is the closest precedent for
an enqueue-time refusal that every trigger path must surface.

## Data model

Migration `452_runtime_cost_budget` creates:

```
runtime_cost_budget
  id                        UUID PRIMARY KEY
  workspace_id              UUID NOT NULL
  runtime_id                UUID NOT NULL
  user_id                   UUID NULL      -- NULL = runtime total
  daily_limit_usd_ticks     BIGINT NULL    -- 1e-10 USD, NULL = unlimited
  weekly_limit_usd_ticks    BIGINT NULL
  monthly_limit_usd_ticks   BIGINT NULL
  daily_notified_period_start   TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
  weekly_notified_period_start  TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
  monthly_notified_period_start TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
  updated_by                UUID NULL
  created_at, updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
```

No foreign keys. A separate single-statement migration builds
`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ... ON runtime_cost_budget (runtime_id, user_id) NULLS NOT DISTINCT`.
A row whose three limits are all NULL is deleted rather than kept, so
"absent row" is the only representation of unlimited. Runtime deletion and
member removal delete matching rows in application code.

Ticks reuse `CostUSDTicksPerUSD` so limits and spend share one unit.

## Server-side pricing

Move the rate table and `PriceForModelAlias` from `server/internal/metrics`
into a new leaf package `server/internal/pricing`; `metrics` imports it.
Add `pricing.EstimateCostTicks(provider, model, costTicks, uncosted tokens)`
which returns provider cost plus priced uncosted tokens, or provider cost
alone when the model is unpriced. This is the only cost formula the server
uses for budgets.

## Spend computation

A sqlc query `ListRuntimeSpendByOwner(runtime_id, scan_floor, daily_start,
weekly_start, monthly_start)` mirrors `ListRuntimeUsageByAgent` but
left-joins `agent`, groups by `agent.owner_id` alongside provider and model,
and computes all three period windows in one pass with
`FILTER (WHERE tu.created_at >= …)` aggregates. The three starts are not
ordered against each other — the current Monday can fall before the first of
the month — so each period picks its own rows with its own `FILTER` rather
than sharing one window. Go folds the result once into a `runtimeSpend`: per
period, a runtime total and a map of `EstimateCostTicks` sums keyed by agent
owner. Agents nobody owns contribute to the total only.

`scan_floor` is computed in Go by `budgetPeriods`, from the periods that carry
a limit on some row of this runtime — not from all three starts. **Ruling:** a
runtime whose only budget is a daily cap must not read a month of `task_usage`
on every enqueue to answer a question about today. The periods left out of the
floor are exactly the ones no caller reads back: `evaluateBudgetRow` and
`scopeStatus` both skip a period with no configured limit, and when no period
has one the fast paths return before the query is issued at all.

One read therefore answers every scope and every period, instead of one
aggregate per (budget row, period): the budget endpoint of a runtime with N
per-user rows costs one spend query rather than 3N+3, and a check costs one
rather than up to six. Spend is still computed on demand for each check and
for the budget endpoint; no running counter is stored, so pricing table
updates and late usage reports never drift from the enforcement figure.

Period start is computed in Go: `pricing.PeriodStart(now, period)`
returns UTC midnight of today, of the current Monday, or of the first of
the month. `ResetAt` is the next boundary.

## Enforcement

`TaskService.checkRuntimeCostBudget(ctx, agent)` runs in every enqueue
helper right after attribution resolves: `enqueueIssueTaskWithCommentPlan`,
`enqueueMentionTaskWithCommentPlan`, `enqueueQuickCreateTask`,
`enqueueChatTaskTx` and `enqueueRerunTask`. It loads the budget rows for
`agent.runtime_id` in one query. With no rows it returns immediately, so
workspaces without budgets pay one indexed lookup per enqueue; a runtime
whose budgets all belong to other owners is just as cheap, because the spend
query is issued only once a row that applies to this agent is known.
Otherwise it loads the runtime's spend once with `ListRuntimeSpendByOwner`
and evaluates the runtime total row and the row for `agent.owner_id` against
it, each period with a limit, and returns
`*RuntimeBudgetExceededError{Scope, Period,
UsedTicks, LimitTicks, PeriodStart, ResetAt, UserID}` on the first reached
limit. Agents with no runtime skip the check.

A new `dispatch.ReasonBudgetExceeded = "budget_exceeded"` is added.
Handlers that type enqueue errors (`commentEnqueueFailureReason`, the chat,
quick-create, rerun and assign paths, and the autopilot attribution branch)
map the error with `errors.As` to that code; synchronous triggers answer
`409` through `writeDispatchBlocked`.

The enqueue helpers are not the only writers of `agent_task_queue`. Every
other path that mints a runnable task carries the same gate, placed where the
executing agent is known and before the row is written:

- **`dispatchRunOnly`** (autopilot `run_only`) resolves its own leader and
  calls `CreateAutopilotTask` directly. A reached budget returns
  `errDispatchSkipped{code: budget_exceeded}`, so the run is recorded
  `skipped` with that reason code — the same shape as the readiness and
  attribution gates beside it, and never a `failed` run. The manual
  "run now" response carries the code on a `200` with the skipped run, as it
  does for every other post-admission skip.
- **`dispatchCreateIssue`** (autopilot `create_issue`) checks the resolved
  leader's budget at the TOP of the function, before any write, and returns the
  same `errDispatchSkipped{code: budget_exceeded}`. **Ruling:** the gate cannot
  wait for the enqueue helper this path calls. That path commits the issue, its
  subscriber fan-out and the quota reservation in one transaction and only then
  enqueues, so a refusal seen at the enqueue would leave a committed issue with
  no task, a consumed reservation, and a `failed` run feeding the failure-rate
  auto-pause monitor — for an autopilot that did nothing wrong. The leader is
  the right scope either way: a squad-assigned autopilot creates the issue
  against the squad and the issue listener routes it to that same leader. The
  enqueue helper keeps its own gate for the window between the two. **Ruling:**
  a refusal that does land in that window stays a `failed` run, not a
  `skipped` one — the issue is committed by then and a `skipped` run claims
  nothing happened — but it is recorded with `reason_code = budget_exceeded`
  and the amount-free `PublicReason()`, never `internal_error` and never the
  limit or running total. `autopilot_run.failure_reason` is readable by anyone
  who can see the autopilot, and the webhook worker persists the same string in
  `webhook_delivery.error`, so the error returned up that chain is wrapped to
  carry the public reason while `errors.As` still reaches the typed refusal.
- **`RetrySourceContextQuickCreate`** (manual source-context retry) checks
  after the invoke gate and the issue-capacity preflight, before its
  transaction, and returns the error unchanged. The retry handler maps it to
  `409` + `budget_exceeded`, matching `writeSourceContextError` on the
  capture path.
- **`dispatchDelegatedFailureRecovery`** checks the coordinator's agent before
  creating the recovery task. A refusal creates nothing and returns no error:
  the durable recovery comment stays in the outbox, so a later sweep replays
  it once the period resets. The sweep counts it as `Blocked` — neither
  replayed nor exhausted.
- **Automatic retries** are suppressed by a reached budget, on both entry
  points (`FailTask`'s in-transaction child and `MaybeRetryFailedTask`), via
  the shared `retrySuppressedByRuntimeBudget` helper. **Ruling:** a reached
  budget stops automatic retries. The parent keeps its own failure reason,
  no child is created, and the log line names the budget as the suppressor.
  The check runs before the transaction on the auto-commit handle, so the
  notice survives; an unreadable budget also suppresses the retry, and never
  fails the parent's own transition. An unreadable *agent* suppresses it too:
  the agent row is what resolves the runtime whose budget gates the retry, so
  without it the budget was never consulted at all.
- **Deferred fallback tasks** are checked at **promotion**, not creation.
  **Ruling:** a fallback armed hours earlier is a prediction about a limit
  that may not have been reached yet; the only moment that matters is when it
  would start spending. `failDueDeferredTasksOverBudget` runs immediately
  before `PromoteDueDeferredTasksForRuntime(s)` in both the single- and
  multi-runtime claim paths: it groups the due `(agent, runtime)` pairs by
  runtime, reads that runtime's budget rows and spend ONCE however many agents
  share it, evaluates each agent against them with the same
  `applicableBudgetRows` / `firstReachedBudget` helpers the enqueue gate uses,
  and for a blocked one flips that agent's due rows on that runtime to `failed`
  with `failure_reason = 'budget_exceeded'` (a new
  `taskfailure.ReasonBudgetExceeded`, sharing the dispatch reason's wire
  value) so the task is visible as a terminal outcome instead of held
  silently. Each retired row then runs the terminal side effects `FailTask`
  runs for a non-retried failure, through the same two shared helpers:
  `writeTerminalChatFailureOutcome` (onboarding-kickoff release plus the
  assistant outcome message) and `reportTerminalTaskFailure` (delegated-failure
  recovery, the per-failure issue comment, the quick-create requester's inbox
  outcome). The retirement is split by row kind, and the split is the
  correctness boundary: a row with a `chat_session_id` is failed in its OWN
  transaction — chat session lock, single-row fail while it is still
  `deferred`, `writeTerminalChatFailureOutcome` — so the status flip and the
  outcome message are atomic for that row, and a row that left `deferred` in
  between is skipped for whatever promoted, cancelled or superseded it. Rows
  without a chat session keep the bulk statement (narrowed to
  `chat_session_id IS NULL`, routed through `terminateTasksInTx` so
  `SettleDeliveredDelegatedFailureRecoveries` commits with the terminal
  write); those carry no atomicity claim beyond their own UPDATE, which is the
  best-effort behaviour the ruling below already states. All retirement writes
  land before any `reportTerminalTaskFailure`, so no chat row waits behind
  another row's recovery dispatch.
  **Ruling:** a deferred row is not only an issue fallback — chat turns park
  there (sealed pending media, retry backoff) and quick-creates are
  retry-eligible — so flipping the status alone would end a refused chat turn
  with a spinner and no reply, and leave a quick-create requester's pending
  state unresolved forever. `budget_exceeded` therefore needs an entry in
  chat's failure-copy map (`chatFailureCopy`) as well as the run-badge maps. One refusal never stops the sweep — every other agent's rows
  promote in the same tick — and a budget or spend the sweep cannot read
  leaves that whole runtime's rows to promote (the read is per runtime, not
  per agent, so one failed load covers every agent on it) rather than retiring
  a member's work over a transient read.
  The pairs come from a query that joins `agent ON a.id = t.agent_id AND
  a.runtime_id = t.runtime_id`, so the budget priced is always the one those
  rows would actually spend against: an agent rebound to another runtime leaves
  rows behind that this gate does not touch at all — neither retired by the new
  runtime's budget nor promoted past the old runtime's.
  **Ruling:** the fail is best-effort against a concurrent promotion. The two
  are separate statements with no transaction around them, so a row that comes
  due in the gap — or that another daemon's claim loop promotes there — can
  still reach `queued` unpriced. Joining them costs more than it buys: the
  promotion's unique-violation on `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent_v2` is
  tolerated today (one row losing its slot must not fail the claim), and inside
  a transaction that error would poison the fail too. The window is one tick
  wide, every row in it passed its own enqueue-time gate, and the overshoot is
  the same bounded kind already accepted for tasks in flight when a limit is
  crossed.
  **Ruling:** the fail is scoped wider than the promotion it precedes. It
  retires every due deferred row of a blocked agent on that runtime, while
  promotion additionally requires the runtime online and fresh, an unoccupied
  `(issue, agent)` slot, and at most one row per `(issue, agent)`. A reached
  budget refuses the work regardless of runtime state or slot occupancy, so a
  due row left deferred would only be a task nobody will ever run, held
  silently until its issue closes.
  `PromoteDeferredChannelIssueTask` and `PromoteChannelChatTasksIfMediaReady`
  are untouched: they promote on media readiness, and the same rows' `fire_at`
  fallback still passes through the gated sweep.

Tasks already queued or running when a limit is reached are not interrupted
and are not filtered at claim time. Runtime deletion (every path, including
profile deletion and the offline-runtime sweeper), member revocation and
workspace deletion remove the runtime's budget rows in the same transaction. The overshoot is bounded by the
in-flight work at the moment the limit is crossed, and the claim path stays
untouched.

## Notification

On the first refusal in a period for a given row and period, the service
creates an inbox item of type `runtime_budget_exceeded` with severity
`attention`, details carrying scope, period, used, limit, reset time and
runtime id as strings. Recipients are the owner of the refused agent and the
runtime owner, de-duplicated, for both scopes. The notice runs on an
auto-commit connection, never inside the enqueue transaction (which the
refusal rolls back), and the runtime and recipients are resolved before the
`*_notified_period_start` claim so a failed lookup cannot consume a period.

The amounts stay inside that notice. `RuntimeBudgetExceededError.Error()`
names the limit, the running total and the reset time, and is used for server
logs only; every string that is persisted or broadcast beyond the notice's
recipients uses `PublicReason()` — `runtime cost budget reached (runtime
daily)` — instead. That covers `agent_task_queue.error` (republished to every
workspace subscriber on `task:failed`) and `autopilot_run.failure_reason`. A
`GET /budget` read is gated on runtime read access and `PUT` withholds spend
from a writer who may not read a private runtime, so a limit carried in one of
those columns would be a workspace-wide way around both. The `409`
`budget_exceeded` responses already answer with the generic
`dispatchBlockedFallbackMessage`, which carries no figures.

## API

`GET /api/runtimes/{id}/budget` (runtime read access):

```json
{
  "runtime": { "daily": { "limit_usd": 20, "used_usd": 3.42,
                          "period_start": "...", "reset_at": "...", "reached": false },
               "weekly": null, "monthly": null },
  "users": [ { "user_id": "...", "daily": null, "weekly": {...}, "monthly": null } ],
  "can_manage": true
}
```

`PUT /api/runtimes/{id}/budget` (the runtime owner only, via
`requireWorkspaceMember` plus `canManageRuntimeBudget`) replaces the whole
budget set:

```json
{ "runtime": { "daily_usd": 20, "weekly_usd": null, "monthly_usd": null },
  "users": [ { "user_id": "...", "daily_usd": null, "weekly_usd": 50, "monthly_usd": null } ] }
```

Validation: amounts are finite, greater than zero, at most 1,000,000 USD,
with at most two decimals; each `user_id` is a workspace member and appears
once. Rows that end up with no limits are deleted. The response is the
`GET` body. The writer is always the runtime owner, who may read their own
runtime, so there is no case where the spend has to be withheld and no `204`
branch. (The API client still tolerates a bodyless `204` — an installed
desktop build may talk to an older backend.)

## Frontend

`packages/core`:

- `RuntimeBudgetSchema` parsed with `parseWithFallback`; types in
  `packages/core/types/agent.ts`; `getRuntimeBudget` and
  `updateRuntimeBudget` in the API client; `runtimeBudgetOptions(runtimeId)`
  under `runtimeKeys`; `useUpdateRuntimeBudget(wsId)` invalidating that key.
- `canManageRuntimeBudget(runtime, ctx)` in `permissions/rules.ts`, an
  owner-identity check with no admin override.
- `budget_exceeded` added wherever `attribution_blocked` is classified, in
  the chat send-failure toasts, and in the mobile dispatch-reason mapper;
  `runtime_budget_exceeded` added to the inbox item type union, the views
  inbox labels and title predicate, and the mobile inbox label record.

`packages/views/runtimes/components`:

- `BudgetSection` rendered in `runtime-detail.tsx` between the hero card and
  the usage section. It is one card with a column header (Scope, Daily,
  Weekly, Monthly) and one row per scope: a "Runtime total" row and one row
  per user with a budget, each with a daily, weekly and monthly meter
  (used / limit, progress bar, reset time). Unlimited periods render as a
  dash. Empty state says no limits are set. A "lower bound" hint appears
  whenever the usage coverage warning already shows.
- The card is collapsed by default and then shows only the "Runtime total"
  row. A footer toggle row styled like the hero card's "Technical details"
  row reads "Show N member budgets" and expands the user rows in place;
  expanded it reads "Hide member budgets". When any hidden user row has a
  reached limit, the collapsed toggle carries a "N limits reached" badge so
  the block is visible without expanding. The open/closed state is
  component state and is not persisted. With no user rows the toggle is
  omitted.
- `RuntimeBudgetDialog` opened from an "Edit budget" button visible only when
  `canManageRuntimeBudget`. It is a table with a fixed "Runtime total" row
  and member rows added through a member picker; three USD inputs per row;
  clearing all inputs on a member row removes it. Save calls the PUT
  mutation and closes on success.
- Inbox label for `runtime_budget_exceeded` and dispatch-blocked copy for
  `budget_exceeded` in the existing places.

Locale keys under `runtimes.budget.*` and the inbox and issues bundles in
`en`, `zh-Hans`, `ja` and `ko`.

## Testing

- `server/internal/pricing`: period boundary table across week starts,
  month ends and year ends in UTC; cost estimate with priced, unpriced and
  provider-costed rows.
- Service: enqueue refused for runtime total, refused for one user while
  another passes, passes with no rows, passes when spend is unpriced,
  notification fires once per period; the spend loader returns every period
  and owner from one call (including a week that starts before the month),
  and the budget endpoint issues exactly one spend query for three per-user
  scopes.
- Handler: `PUT` returns 200 for the runtime owner even when they are a plain
  workspace member, 403 for the workspace owner and for an admin who does not
  own the runtime, 403 for everyone on an ownerless runtime; it rejects
  invalid amounts and non-members and deletes emptied rows. `GET` reports used
  and reached, and `can_manage` is true only for the runtime owner.
- `packages/core`: schema malformed-response test, permission rule test,
  query key test.
- `packages/views`: `BudgetSection` empty and populated states, collapsed by
  default with the toggle expanding user rows and the reached badge, button
  gated by runtime ownership, dialog save wiring.
